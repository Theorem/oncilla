# Network

To connect your app to your server, you need a talking channel. The default choice on the web is WebSockets.

To let Oncilla DB talk to your server, youâ€™ll need to implement an endpoint. See [the Oncilla WebSocket protocol mini-specification](wsProtocol.md) to see what you need to do.

On the client side, use our custom Oncilla WebSocket adapter:

```js
import { makeWsProtocolAdapter } from "oncilla";
const network = makeWsProtocolAdapter({
  url: "wss://example.com/"
});
```
