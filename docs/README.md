# Oncilla documentation

If you’re new to Oncilla, see the [starting guide](./starting-guide.md).

If you’re using Oncilla, most likely you want to see the [documentation about React-specific features](./react.md).

React is not strictly required, but to integrate with anything else, you will need to integrate directly with [Oncilla core](./core.md).

You need to connect your Oncilla to your backend. See the [network-related documentation](./network/README.md).
